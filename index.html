                     <i>Breeze Sans</i> and <i>Calibri</i> will be used. The decision was clear, as both fonts fit with the hook of outdoor photography. <i>Breeze Sans</i> will serve as the main font-family, used for paragraphs and smaller text elements. <i>Calibri</i> is a very strong bold font, and will be used for larger text elements, such as the temperature or rainfall weather components.
